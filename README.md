# Update Pi-hole's lists from remote sources

When using remote lists like [this](https://v.firebog.net/hosts/lists.php?type=tick) or [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anudeepND/whitelist/master/domains/whitelist.txt) it's a hassle to manually check for changes and update, this script will do that for you.

This script will not touch user-created entries, entries that were removed from the remote list will be disabled instead of removed.

### Requirements

- Pi-hole v5+ installed (fresh install preferred)
- php-cli >=7.0 and sqlite3 extension (`sudo apt install php-cli php-sqlite3`)
- systemd distro is optional but recommended

Without **systemd** you will have to take care of scheduled run of this script yourself.

### Install

This will install this script globally as `pihole-updatelists` and add systemd service and timer.

```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirouk/pihole-updatelists/master/install.sh | sudo bash
```

Alternatively you can clone this repo and `sudo bash ./install.sh`.

In the future to quickly update the script you can use `sudo pihole-updatelists --update`.

#### Disable default gravity update schedule

_If you don't plan on updating adlists you can skip this and set `UPDATE_GRAVITY=false` in the configuration file._

You should disable entry with `pihole updateGravity` command in `/etc/cron.d/pihole` as this script already runs it:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/cron.d/pihole
```
Put a `#` before this line (numbers might be different):
```
#49 4   * * 7   root    PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin/" pihole updateGravity >/var/log/pihole_updateGravity.log || cat /var/log/pihole_updateGravity.log
```

**You might have to do this after each Pi-hole update.**

#### Migrating lists and domains

If you already imported any of the remote lists manually you should migrate their entries to allow the script to disable them in case they are removed from the remote list.

If you used [pihole5-list-tool](https://github.com/jessedp/pihole5-list-tool) to import adlists and whitelist you can use this commands to do this quickly:
```bash
sudo sqlite3 /etc/pihole/gravity.db "UPDATE adlist SET comment = 'Managed by pihole-updatelists' WHERE comment LIKE '%Firebog |%'"
sudo sqlite3 /etc/pihole/gravity.db "UPDATE domainlist SET comment = 'Managed by pihole-updatelists' WHERE comment LIKE '%AndeepND |%'"
```
_(code up to date as of pihole5-list-tool 0.5.0)_

Alternatively, some manual work is required - pick one:

- Manually modify comment field of all imported domains/adlists to match the one this script uses (see `COMMENT` variable in **Configuration** section)  **(recommended but might be a lot of work)**
- Manually delete all imported domains/adlists from the web interface  (might be a lot of work)
- Wipe all adlists and domains (not recommended but fast - use this if you want to start fresh)
	- backup default lists and custom entries (write them down somewhere, do not use the Teleporter)
	- run the following commands:
	```bash
	sudo sqlite3 /etc/pihole/gravity.db "DELETE FROM adlist"
	sudo sqlite3 /etc/pihole/gravity.db "DELETE FROM domainlist"
	```
    - keep reading and configure the script then run `sudo pihole-updatelists` to finish up

### Configuration

Default configuration file is `/etc/pihole-updatelists.conf`.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/pihole-updatelists.conf
```

#### Available variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| ADLISTS_URL | " " | Remote list URL containing list of adlists to import |
| WHITELIST_URL | " " | Remote list URL containing exact domains to whitelist |
| REGEX_WHITELIST_URL | " " | Remote list URL containing regex rules for whitelisting |
| BLACKLIST_URL | " " | Remote list URL containing exact domains to blacklist |
| REGEX_BLACKLIST_URL | " " | Remote list URL containing regex rules for blacklisting |
| COMMENT | "Managed by pihole-updatelists" | Comment string used to know which entries were created by the script |
| GROUP_ID | 0 | Assign additional group to all inserted entries, to assign only the specified group make the number negative, `0` is the default group |
| REQUIRE_COMMENT | true | Prevent touching entries not created by this script by comparing comment field |
| UPDATE_GRAVITY | true | Update gravity after lists are updated? (runs `pihole updateGravity`, when disabled will invoke lists reload instead) |
| VACUUM_DATABASE | false | Vacuum database at the end? (runs `VACUUM` SQLite command) |
| VERBOSE | false | Print more information while script is running? |
| DEBUG | false | Print even more information for debugging purposes |
| DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT | 60 | Maximum time in seconds one list download can take before giving up (you should increase this when downloads fail) | 
| GRAVITY_DB | "/etc/pihole/gravity.db" | Path to `gravity.db` in case you need to change it |
| LOCK_FILE | "/var/lock/pihole-updatelists.lock" | Process lockfile to prevent multiple instances of the script, you shouldn't change it - unless `/var/lock` is unavailable |
| LOG_FILE | " " | Log console output to file (put `-` before path to overwrite file instead of appending to it), typically `/var/log/pihole-updatelists.log` is good |

String values should be put between `" "`, otherwise weird things might happen.

You can also give paths to the local files instead of URLs, for example setting `WHITELIST_URL` to `/home/pi/whitelist.txt` will fetch this file from filesystem.

You can specify alternative config file by passing the path to the script through `config` parameter: `pihole-updatelists --config=/home/pi/pihole-updatelists2.conf` - this combined with different `COMMENT` string can allow multiple script configurations for the same Pi-hole instance.

#### Multiple list URLs:

You can pass multiple URLs to the list variables by separating them with whitespace (space or new line):

```bash
ADLISTS_URL="https://v.firebog.net/hosts/lists.php?type=tick  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/you/adlists/master/my_adlists.txt"
```

If one of the lists fails to download nothing will be affected for that list type.

#### Recommended lists:

| List | URL | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| ADLISTS_URL | https://v.firebog.net/hosts/lists.php?type=tick | https://firebog.net - safe lists only |
| WHITELIST_URL | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anudeepND/whitelist/master/domains/whitelist.txt | https://github.com/anudeepND/whitelist - commonly whitelisted |
| REGEX_BLACKLIST_URL | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmotti/pihole-regex/master/regex.list | https://github.com/mmotti/pihole-regex - basic regex rules |

### Runtime options

| Option | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| -help, -h | Show help message, which is simply this list |
| --config=[FILE], -c=[FILE] | Load alternative configuration file |
| --no-gravity, -n | Force gravity update to be skipped |
| --no-vacuum, -m | Force database vacuuming to be skipped |
| --verbose, -v | Turn on verbose mode (affects log) |
| --debug, -d  | Turn on debug mode (affects log) |
| --update, -u  | Update the script - compares local script with the one in the repository and overwrites it if they are different |

### Changing the schedule

By default, the script runs at random time (around 04:00am), to change it you'll have to override [timer unit](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.timer.html) file:
 
```bash
sudo systemctl edit pihole-updatelists.timer
```
```
[Timer]
RandomizedDelaySec=5m
OnCalendar=*-*-* 4:00:00
```

### Running custom commands before/after scheduled run

Override [service unit](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html) file:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit pihole-updatelists.service
```
```
[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStartPre=sudo pihole-updatelists -u
ExecStartPost=echo "after"
```

### Changing comment value after running the script

```bash
sudo sqlite3 /etc/pihole/gravity.db "UPDATE adlist SET comment = 'NEWCOMMENT' WHERE comment LIKE '%Managed by pihole-updatelists%'"
sudo sqlite3 /etc/pihole/gravity.db "UPDATE domainlist SET comment = 'NEWCOMMENT' WHERE comment LIKE '%Managed by pihole-updatelists%'"
```

Replace `NEWCOMMENT` with your new desired comment value. This assumes `Managed by pihole-updatelists` is the old comment value, replace it with your old custom value when needed.
